1. Data Analysis and Preparation
2. Data Exploration
3. Data Preprocessing (Feature Engineering)
4. Build Machine Learning Project
    1. Data Preparation (Train/Test Split)
    2. Prediction with Logistic Regression
    3. Prediction with Decision Tree
    4. Prediction with Gaussian Naive Bayes
    5. Prediction with Random Forest
    
    6. Feature Scaling - Normalization
    7. Prediction with Support Vector Machine
    8. Prediction with K-Nearest Neighbors
    
5. Evaluating Model
6. Testing Model with mini application
7. Derived Conclusion
